# Project--ML-21


<table>

**In this project we have applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on Fashion MNIST dataset to get the best 3 principal components and thus reducing it from higher dimensions to lower dimensions and plotting a 3d plot of that.**

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data.


**Steps**: <br></br>

 **For First Plot**:  <br></br>
1.Reading the csv file as DataFrame<br></br>
2.Creating the PCA object with 3 main components.<br></br>
3.Making a 3d plot on that without any filtering,Standardization or any data preprocessing steps.<br></br>


 **For Second Plot**: <br></br>
1.Reading the csv file as DataFrame<br></br>
2.Filtering out Target Variables/Dependent Variables and Independent Variables<br></br>
3. Standard Scaling<br></br>
4. Splitting the data into training and testing set<br></br>
5. Creating the PCA object with 3 main components.<br></br>
5. Making a 3d plot.<br></br>


**Important Note:**  Please go through the dataset once before jumping to the code.
